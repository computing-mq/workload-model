      <h2>About the Model</h2>

      <p>The data presented here comes from the application of the Faculty Workload Model 
        to the Teaching activities of Computing staff.  All loadings come from the model but 
        there are a few assumptions made.
      </p>

     <h4>Workload Points</h4>

      <p>The FSE Model is expressed in terms of workload points, with 100 points being
      a full time workload of 1575 hours per year.  Hence 1 point corresponds roughly
      to 15.75 hours of workload.  As stated in the FSE document: "The reason for this decision is to avoid the perception that the model is an accurate hour-by-hour measure of the time taken for any given task. Any workload model is inevitably inaccurate and can only give an approximate measure of the relative time taken for different tasks."</p>


      <h4>Convening</h4>

      <p>The Faculty model for convening covers activities that are shared by co-lecturers 
        in our units. Hence part of the convening load is shared between lecturing staff. 
        First the convening load for a unit is calculated, including load for consultation
        time and assessment development.  Of this 0.5 is given to the convener, with the
        remaining 0.5 shared between co-lecturers. So a convener who is also a lecturer on 
        the unit would normally get 0.75 of the convening/consultation/assessment prep load.
      </p>

      <p>Convening loads are based on estimated or actual enrollments in the unit.</p>


      <h4>Lecturing and Marking</h4>

      <p>Lecturing load is calculated based on 13 weeks of lectures with the number of hours 
        per week varying for each unit (normally 3).
      </p>

      <p>Marking load is assigned seperately. A cap on marking load per unit is calculated based on
        1 hr per student enrolment to cover exam and assignment marking.
      </p>

      <h4>Administrative Roles</h4>

      <p>While this is mainly a teaching model we do include some admin roles where they affect
        the target teaching load. For example, Director of Teaching is modelled at 7.5 points/semester 
        under the `unit' ADMIN001.
      </p>

      <h4>Bonus Points</h4>

      <p>Bonus points are added for various reasons including being new to a unit, developing
        a new unit or for new appointees in their first year.  
      </p>
      
      <h4>Implementation</h4>

      <p>The model is implemented in Python with this front-end visualisation in Vanilla Javascript.
